# Main Sequence
## A high-contrast dark theme for VSCode/VSCodium
### Installation
The easiest method is to Ctrl-Shift-P in VSCodium, select "Extensions: Install from VSIX", and point it at the azcobu.main-sequence-0.0.1-universal.vsix file in the repo root.

Alternately, you can install it manually:
1. Find the extensions folder for VSCode:
   * Linux: `~/.vscode/extensions` - for VSCodium it's `~/.vscode-oss/extensions`
   * Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`
   * macOS: `~/.vscode/extensions`
2. Copy the  folder 'azcobu.main-sequence-0.0.1-universal' and its contents into it.
3. Restart VSC, and go to File > Preferences > Theme > Color Theme, click, and select Main Sequence from the list.
